                        1. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE
================================================================================

WHAT IS THIS TOOL?

The INAD Analysis Tool is designed to identify airlines and routes with
systematically elevated rates of inadmissible passengers (INADs). Its purpose
is to support legal review by distinguishing between:

    - Isolated incidents that may not require action
    - Systemic patterns that warrant investigation or enforcement

The tool processes two data sources:
    1. INAD records: Cases of passengers refused entry at Swiss borders
    2. BAZL passenger data: Total passenger volumes by airline and route

By comparing INAD counts against passenger volumes, we can identify which
airlines or routes have disproportionately high INAD rates relative to their
traffic, suggesting potential systemic issues with passenger screening.


WHO SHOULD USE THIS DOCUMENTATION?

This documentation is written for members of the legal team who will review
the analysis results and make decisions about further investigation, warnings,
or enforcement actions. Technical knowledge of statistics or programming is
not required.


================================================================================
                    2. THE THREE-STEP ANALYSIS PROCESS
================================================================================

The analysis follows a progressive filtering approach, each step narrowing
down the focus to identify the most significant cases.


STEP 1: AIRLINE-LEVEL SCREENING (Prüfstufe 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE: Identify airlines with a meaningful number of INAD cases

HOW IT WORKS:
    - Count the total number of INADs for each airline in the semester
    - Flag airlines with 6 or more INADs (configurable threshold)
    - Airlines below this threshold are excluded from further analysis

WHY 6 INADs?
    - A small number of INADs (1-5) could easily be random occurrences
    - Setting a minimum threshold ensures we focus on statistically
      meaningful patterns rather than isolated incidents
    - This threshold can be adjusted based on policy requirements

EXAMPLE:
    Airline LX: 105 INADs  → Passes Step 1 (≥6)
    Airline XY:   3 INADs  → Does not pass (below threshold)


STEP 2: ROUTE-LEVEL SCREENING (Prüfstufe 2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE: From airlines identified in Step 1, identify specific routes with
         elevated INAD counts

HOW IT WORKS:
    - For each airline that passed Step 1, count INADs by route (origin airport)
    - Flag routes with 6 or more INADs
    - Routes below this threshold are excluded from Step 3

WHY ANALYZE BY ROUTE?
    - An airline might have high total INADs but concentrated on one route
    - This helps identify specific problem origins rather than penalizing
      an airline's entire operation
    - Example: An airline might have excellent compliance on most routes
      but issues with passengers from one specific origin

EXAMPLE:
    LX → DUB (Dublin):     10 INADs  → Passes Step 2
    LX → LHR (London):      7 INADs  → Passes Step 2
    LX → CDG (Paris):       2 INADs  → Does not pass


STEP 3: DENSITY ANALYSIS (Prüfstufe 3)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE: Compare INAD counts against passenger volumes to identify
         disproportionately high rates

HOW IT WORKS:
    1. For each route from Step 2, retrieve the passenger count (PAX)
    2. Calculate the INAD density: (INADs / PAX) × 1000
       This gives INADs per 1,000 passengers
    3. Calculate the threshold (average or median of all densities)
    4. Flag routes above the threshold for legal review

WHY USE DENSITY INSTEAD OF RAW COUNTS?
    - Raw INAD counts favor large airlines unfairly
    - A route with 20 INADs and 500,000 passengers (0.04‰) is performing
      better than a route with 10 INADs and 20,000 passengers (0.50‰)
    - Density provides a fair, relative comparison across different
      traffic volumes

EXAMPLE:
    Route A: 10 INADs, 100,000 PAX → Density = 0.10‰
    Route B:  8 INADs,  40,000 PAX → Density = 0.20‰

    Route B has fewer INADs but a HIGHER density, indicating a more
    significant issue relative to its traffic.


================================================================================
                   3. UNDERSTANDING THE ENHANCED FEATURES
================================================================================

The enhanced version introduces several improvements to make the analysis
more reliable and actionable for legal review.


3.1 ROBUST THRESHOLD CALCULATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREVIOUS APPROACH:
    Used simple arithmetic mean (average) to calculate the threshold

PROBLEM:
    The mean is highly sensitive to outliers. A single extreme value can
    dramatically skew the threshold, leading to incorrect classifications.

    Example from actual data (2016 H2):
    One route had incomplete passenger data, showing only 51 passengers
    but 7 INADs, creating an artificial density of 137‰. This single
    outlier raised the average from ~0.1‰ to 22.9‰, making all other
    routes appear to be performing well when they might not be.

NEW APPROACH:
    Uses MEDIAN as the default threshold calculation

    - The median is the middle value when all densities are sorted
    - It is not affected by extreme outliers
    - One bad data point cannot skew the entire analysis

    Alternative: TRIMMED MEAN
    - Removes the top and bottom 10% of values before averaging
    - Less extreme than median but still robust against outliers


3.2 MINIMUM PASSENGER THRESHOLD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREVIOUS APPROACH:
    All routes were included regardless of passenger volume

PROBLEM:
    Routes with very few passengers produce unreliable density calculations.
    6 INADs on a route with only 100 passengers gives 60‰ density, but this
    is statistically meaningless - it could easily be random variation.

NEW APPROACH:
    Routes with fewer than 5,000 passengers are marked as UNRELIABLE

    - These routes are still shown but flagged with a warning
    - They are excluded from threshold calculation
    - Legal team can see them but should interpret with caution
    - The 5,000 threshold is configurable based on policy needs


3.3 PRIORITY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREVIOUS APPROACH:
    Routes were simply marked as "above average" or "below average"

PROBLEM:
    This binary classification doesn't distinguish between:
    - Routes barely above average (minor concern)
    - Routes significantly above average (major concern)
    - Routes with data quality issues (uncertain)

NEW APPROACH:
    Four-tier priority classification:

    🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
       Requires immediate legal review
       Criteria (ALL must be met):
       - Density ≥ 1.5× the threshold
       - Density ≥ 0.10‰ (absolute minimum)
       - At least 10 INAD cases
       - Reliable data (≥5,000 passengers)

    🟠 WATCH LIST
       Should be monitored; may escalate
       Criteria:
       - Density ≥ threshold
       - Does not meet all HIGH PRIORITY criteria

    🟢 CLEAR
       No action required
       Criteria:
       - Density < threshold

    ⚪ UNRELIABLE
       Data quality concerns; interpret with caution
       Criteria:
       - Fewer than 5,000 passengers
       - Or incomplete passenger data


3.4 CONFIDENCE SCORING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREVIOUS APPROACH:
    No indication of how reliable each result was

PROBLEM:
    A route with 6 INADs and 10,000 passengers has much less statistical
    certainty than a route with 50 INADs and 200,000 passengers. Legal
    team had no way to assess this.

NEW APPROACH:
    Each route receives a confidence score from 0-100%

    Based on:
    - INAD count (more cases = more confidence)
    - Passenger volume (more passengers = more reliable denominator)

    Interpretation:
    - 0-30%:  Low confidence, treat results with caution
    - 30-60%: Medium confidence, results are indicative
    - 60-100%: High confidence, results are reliable

    Higher confidence scores mean you can trust the density calculation
    more when making legal decisions.


3.5 DATA QUALITY CHECKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREVIOUS APPROACH:
    No validation of input data quality

PROBLEM:
    The 2016 H2 case showed that incomplete passenger data (only 1 month
    recorded instead of 6) can produce wildly inaccurate results.

NEW APPROACH:
    Automatic data quality checks with warnings:

    "Incomplete PAX data (2/6 months)"
        - Passenger data exists for fewer than 4 of 6 months
        - Density calculation may be inaccurate

    "Low PAX volume (<5,000)"
        - Total passengers too low for reliable statistics

    "High variance in monthly PAX data"
        - Unusual fluctuations in passenger numbers
        - May indicate data recording issues

    These warnings appear in the dashboard and are included in exports
    so the legal team is aware of potential data issues.


3.6 SYSTEMIC CASE DETECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREVIOUS APPROACH:
    Each semester was analyzed independently

PROBLEM:
    A single semester's results might be a one-time anomaly. True systemic
    issues would appear repeatedly across multiple time periods.

NEW APPROACH:
    Multi-semester analysis identifies SYSTEMIC cases:

    Definition: A route is SYSTEMIC if it appears on the WATCH LIST or
    HIGH PRIORITY in 2 or more consecutive semesters

    Additional information provided:
    - Total appearances across all semesters
    - Maximum consecutive appearances
    - Trend direction (IMPROVING or WORSENING)
    - Percentage change in density over time

    This helps legal team distinguish between:
    - One-time issues (may not require action)
    - Persistent patterns (stronger case for enforcement)


3.7 REFUSAL CODE CATEGORIZATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREVIOUS APPROACH:
    Refusal codes were only used for filtering (excluding certain codes)

NEW APPROACH:
    Refusal codes are categorized and displayed for each flagged route:

    Categories:
    - Documentation: Missing or invalid travel documents
    - Fraud: Forged or falsified documents
    - Visa: Visa-related issues (expired, wrong type, overstay)
    - Security: Security concerns, entry bans

    This helps legal team understand the NATURE of the problem:
    - Documentation issues might suggest training problems
    - Fraud patterns might suggest organized crime
    - Visa overstays might suggest specific origin issues

================================================================================
                  6. INTERPRETING RESULTS FOR LEGAL REVIEW
================================================================================

RECOMMENDED REVIEW PROCESS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. START WITH THE LEGAL SUMMARY TAB
   - Review HIGH PRIORITY routes first
   - These have the strongest statistical basis for action
   - Note the confidence scores - higher is more reliable

2. CHECK FOR SYSTEMIC CASES
   - Routes appearing as systemic have persisted over time
   - These represent the strongest cases for enforcement
   - Review their trend - worsening trends are more concerning

3. REVIEW WATCH LIST FOR CONTEXT
   - These routes are above average but don't meet all HIGH criteria
   - May escalate to HIGH PRIORITY next semester
   - Consider for warning letters or monitoring

4. NOTE DATA QUALITY WARNINGS
   - Be cautious with UNRELIABLE classifications
   - If a route has quality warnings, results may not support action
   - Consider requesting better data before proceeding

5. EXPORT FOR DOCUMENTATION
   - Use export buttons to create records
   - Include analysis parameters in your documentation


WHAT EACH PRIORITY LEVEL MEANS FOR ACTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
   Statistical basis: Strong
   Recommended action: Formal investigation, potential warning or fine
   Documentation: Include density, threshold comparison, confidence score

🟠 WATCH LIST
   Statistical basis: Moderate
   Recommended action: Monitor, consider informal outreach
   Documentation: Note for next semester review

🟢 CLEAR
   Statistical basis: Below threshold
   Recommended action: No action required

⚪ UNRELIABLE
   Statistical basis: Insufficient data
   Recommended action: Do not take enforcement action
   Documentation: Note data quality issues


IMPORTANT CAVEATS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Statistical indicators are not proof
   - High density indicates a pattern worth investigating
   - Root cause analysis is still required before action

2. Context matters
   - Some origins may have inherently higher INAD rates
   - Consider geopolitical factors, visa regimes, etc.

3. Data limitations
   - Passenger data may be incomplete for some routes
   - Always check data quality warnings

4. Threshold is relative
   - Being above the median means above half of peers
   - It does not mean the absolute rate is necessarily problematic


================================================================================
               7. WHY THE NEW APPROACH IS MORE ROBUST
================================================================================

COMPARISON: OLD VS. NEW METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE 1: Outlier Sensitivity

    OLD: One route with bad data could skew the entire semester's results

    NEW: Median-based threshold ignores extreme values
         Data quality checks flag suspicious data
         Minimum PAX threshold excludes unreliable routes

    RESULT: Analysis is stable and reproducible


ISSUE 2: Binary Classification

    OLD: Routes were either "above average" or "below average"
         No distinction between marginally above and significantly above

    NEW: Four-tier system with clear criteria
         HIGH PRIORITY reserved for clearly significant cases
         WATCH LIST for borderline cases
         UNRELIABLE for data quality issues

    RESULT: Proportionate response based on severity


ISSUE 3: Single Semester View

    OLD: Each semester analyzed in isolation
         No way to identify persistent vs. one-time issues

    NEW: Systemic case detection across all semesters
         Trend analysis shows improvement or deterioration
         Historical view for each route

    RESULT: Better identification of truly systemic problems


ISSUE 4: No Confidence Indication

    OLD: All results presented with equal weight
         No way to know how reliable a calculation was

    NEW: Confidence scores based on sample size
         Clear warnings for low-confidence results

    RESULT: Legal team can prioritize high-confidence cases


ISSUE 5: Hidden Data Problems

    OLD: Data quality issues not detected or reported
         Wrong conclusions from bad data

    NEW: Automatic quality checks
         Visible warnings in dashboard
         Unreliable routes flagged separately

    RESULT: Transparent about limitations


ISSUE 6: Language Barriers

    OLD: English-only interface
         Non-English speakers required translation assistance

    NEW: Full multilingual support (EN/DE/FR)
         Native language interface for all Swiss official languages
         Immediate language switching

    RESULT: Accessible to all team members


STATISTICAL VALIDITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The new approach follows established statistical best practices:

1. ROBUST STATISTICS
   Using median instead of mean is a standard technique in statistics
   when outliers may be present. It is used in scientific research,
   financial analysis, and regulatory contexts worldwide.

2. MINIMUM SAMPLE SIZE
   The 5,000 passenger threshold ensures that density calculations
   are based on sufficient data. With small samples, random variation
   can produce misleading results.

3. MULTI-PERIOD ANALYSIS
   Looking at patterns across multiple semesters reduces the chance
   of acting on random fluctuations. This is similar to how financial
   regulators look at trends rather than single data points.

4. CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
   While not showing formal statistical confidence intervals, the
   confidence score provides an intuitive measure of reliability
   that helps non-statisticians interpret results appropriately.


================================================================================
                      8. CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
================================================================================

All parameters can be adjusted in the dashboard sidebar. Here is what each
parameter controls and recommended settings:


MINIMUM INAD THRESHOLD (Default: 6)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it does: Sets the minimum number of INADs for Step 1 and Step 2
Range: 1-20

Recommendations:
- 6: Standard setting, balances sensitivity and specificity
- Lower (3-5): More sensitive, catches smaller patterns
- Higher (8-10): More conservative, only flags clear patterns


MINIMUM PAX FOR RELIABLE DATA (Default: 5,000)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it does: Routes with fewer passengers are marked UNRELIABLE
Range: 1,000-20,000

Recommendations:
- 5,000: Standard setting, reasonable statistical basis
- Lower: Include more routes but with less confidence
- Higher: More conservative, only highest-confidence results


THRESHOLD CALCULATION METHOD (Default: Median)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Options:
- Median: Middle value, most robust against outliers (RECOMMENDED)
- Trimmed Mean: Removes top/bottom 10% then averages
- Mean: Simple average (NOT RECOMMENDED - sensitive to outliers)


MINIMUM DENSITY FOR HIGH PRIORITY (Default: 0.10‰)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it does: Even if above threshold, must exceed this absolute minimum
Range: 0.05-0.30‰

Recommendations:
- 0.10‰: Standard setting
- Lower: More routes qualify as HIGH PRIORITY
- Higher: Only the most severe cases flagged


HIGH PRIORITY MULTIPLIER (Default: 1.5×)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it does: Must be this multiple of threshold for HIGH PRIORITY
Range: 1.0-3.0

Recommendations:
- 1.5×: Standard setting (50% above threshold)
- Lower (1.2-1.3): More sensitive
- Higher (2.0+): Only extreme cases flagged
